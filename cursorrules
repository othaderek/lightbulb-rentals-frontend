# Cursor Rules - Lightbulb Rentals Frontend

## Documentation Requirements

**Before starting any work session:**
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for the overall plan and current phase
2. Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` for what's already been completed
3. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` for architecture decisions that have been made
4. Read `docs/BLOCKERS.md` for known issues or things waiting on external input

**After completing work:**
1. Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with:
   - Date
   - What was accomplished (files created/modified)
   - What's ready for next session
   - Any new blockers discovered

2. Update `docs/DECISIONS.md` if any architecture or implementation decisions were made, including:
   - The decision
   - Rationale
   - Date
   - Alternatives considered (if relevant)

3. Update `docs/BLOCKERS.md` if:
   - New blockers discovered (waiting on CEO, unclear requirements, etc.)
   - Existing blockers resolved (mark as resolved with date)

4. Update `CLAUDE.md` checkboxes if tasks were completed

## Documentation Format

### PROGRESS.md Format
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD
- Completed: [specific task]
- Created: `path/to/file.tsx`
- Modified: `path/to/existing-file.tsx`
- Next up: [what should happen next session]
- Blocker: [if any]
```

### DECISIONS.md Format
```markdown
## [Short Decision Title]
**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Rationale:** [Why]
**Alternatives considered:** [Optional - what else was considered]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

### BLOCKERS.md Format
```markdown
## [Blocker Title]
**Status:** Open | Resolved
**Waiting on:** [CEO / External / Technical investigation]
**Description:** [Details]
**Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Resolved:** YYYY-MM-DD (if resolved)
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use named exports over default exports
- Colocate components with their pages when page-specific
- Shared components go in `components/`
- API functions go in `lib/api/`
- Static data constants go in `lib/data/`
- Types go in `types/index.ts`

## Project Context

This is a film equipment rental website for Lightbulb Rentals (NYC, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh).

**Key constraints:**
- Lead-generation site, not e-commerce (no shopping cart)
- Quote requests go through existing Gravity Forms on WordPress
- Stores and studios are hardcoded constants (not from API)
- Inventory data comes from .NET API (uses mock data until API ready)
- No chat widgets, no AI mentions, no corporate jargon
- Mobile-first, fast page loads

**Reference sites for UX:**
- Lensrentals.com (data density)
- BHPhoto.com (search, hidden SEO text)
- McMaster.com (speed)

## When Asked to Implement Features

1. Check if the feature is in `CLAUDE.md` and its current priority
2. Check `docs/PROGRESS.md` to see if related work was started
3. Check `docs/DECISIONS.md` for any relevant prior decisions
4. Check `docs/BLOCKERS.md` to see if there are known blockers
5. If unclear, ask before implementing
6. After implementing, update all relevant docs

## Ending a Session

When the user says "let's wrap up", "end session", "summarize", or similar:

1. Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished
2. Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with the session's work
3. Update `docs/DECISIONS.md` if decisions were made
4. Update `docs/BLOCKERS.md` if blockers were found or resolved
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` checkboxes for completed tasks
6. Suggest what to work on next session
